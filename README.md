## Hi there 👋


 I'm elias, an aspiring software and security engineer!! <br>
 My goal is to be able to design and build anything! <br>
 Planning to learn many languages....(so far only worked on Html,Css, Java, Javascript and Go) <br>
 Currently no projects but hopefully soon... <br>

# ⚡ Fun facts:
- I'm an enjoyer of media in general (Games, Animanga, movies and series)
- I love taking care of pets
- I don't drink coffee

# Gentle Reminder:
- If you improve anything by 1% each day, by the end of the year, you will be 37 times better
